# Create a bond with no IP addressing assigned:
# The trick for me was disabling ipv4 on the bond
# Im using mode 802.3ad (Link Aggregation Protocolo - LACP). This mode requires that the network Switch has this feature
# Ask your network team to configure that in advance

# Create a VLAN on top of bond0 with the IP addressing. The following assumes a VLAN ID of 10. Use either DHCP or set a static IP address:

### Using DHCP for IP addressing:
# nmcli connection add type vlan ifname bond0.10 con-name bond0.10 id 10 dev bond0

### With a static IP of  10.20.30.10/24 and gateway of 10.20.30.1:
nmcli connection add type vlan ifname bond0.10 con-name bond0.10 id 10 dev bond0 ip4 10.20.30.10/24 gw4 10.20.30.1

# add DNS server
nmcli connection modify bond0.10 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1"

# Finally run the next command to verify that your DNS are properly configured
